# TuxOS

**A tiny operating system written from scratch – boots into a simple shell.**

## About

TuxOS is a minimal 32‑bit operating system for x86.  
It has its own bootloader, a VGA text‑mode console, PS/2 keyboard driver with shift support, and a command‑line shell.

**Version:** Early 0.1 (development preview)

## Features

- Custom bootloader (sector 1) that loads the kernel and switches to protected mode
- Write‑direct‑to‑VGA text console (80×25, 16 colours)
- PS/2 keyboard input with uppercase/lowercase and backspace
- Built‑in shell with commands:
  - `help` – list available commands
  - `whoami` – prints `root`
  - `echo <text>` – print text back
  - `clear` – clear the screen
  - `uname` – prints `TuxOS`
  - `date` – shows a hardcoded date (real clock coming soon)
  - `ls`, `pwd` – fake filesystem placeholders
  - `ver` – version information
  - `tux` – draws a small ASCII penguin
  - `shutdown` – power off (QEMU/Bochs/VirtualBox)
  - `reboot` – reboot the machine
- APM shutdown fallback
- QEMU and real‑hardware bootable (via floppy image)

## Building

### Requirements

- Linux (or WSL on Windows)
- `nasm` (assembler)
- `gcc` with 32‑bit support (`gcc‑multilib` or cross‑compiler)
- `ld` (GNU linker)
- `make`
- `qemu-system-i386` (for testing)

Install on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm gcc-multilib build-essential qemu-system-x86 make
```

### Build & Run

```bash
make clean
make
make run
```

This assembles the bootloader, compiles the kernel, creates a 1.44 MB floppy image (`os-image.bin`), and starts QEMU.

## Creating a USB bootable image

Write the floppy image directly to a USB drive:

```bash
sudo dd if=os-image.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=2880 status=progress
sync
```

(Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB device – double‑check it’s correct.)

**Warning:** This is a hobby project. Do not run on production hardware (unless you know what you’re doing).  
There is no filesystem, no memory protection, and the shutdown command might not physically power off all real machines – it works in emulators and most vintage PCs.
